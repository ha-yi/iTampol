# iTampol

An open source project to create affordable smart devices to sort
accepted or rejected farming products, example use sorting accepted Coffee beans,
separate un-ripped Tomatoes from ripped tomatoes, and many other.

This devices utilising:
- Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266)
- Android devices with camera

The Idea is using Machine learning to train which one is rejected, and 
which one is accepted. Using OpenCV to detect objects, and then using 
TensorFlow lite to automatically recognize accepted objects and rejected object.

Depend on the mechanism, it could be fast and can be slow.
